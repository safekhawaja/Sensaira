Sensaira is an __*anti-pollution watch biosensor*__ that detects and responds to low oxygen levels in urban environments through gold yeast, and it notifies users through visual and audio feedback with a color change and emergency alarm. 

This biosensor has the parts of a wearable “watch,” genetically-modified yeast, a micro-controller and power source for Internet connectivity, integrated Bluetooth features (to connect to Apple Health or another application), and a method of detaching the dial to replace the yeast. The form is a re-imagining of the now redundant watch thanks to phones.

The interaction is displayed through a gradient change of color in the bacteria. An alarm output is integrated into the device to ring if the concentration of toxins in the air is too high. This alarm will also be linked to an app that tracks data, and uses a greater network to send warning notifications to other people, if certain areas are extremely polluted.
